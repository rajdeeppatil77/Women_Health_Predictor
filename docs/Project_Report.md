# Project Report: Women Health Predictor

## Abstract
The Women Health Predictor is a digital initiative aimed at improving healthcare accessibility for tribal and rural women. By leveraging Machine Learning and a simplified user interface, the application provides instant disease risk assessment, health education via a chatbot, and immediate access to emergency services. This project addresses the critical gap in healthcare awareness and infrastructure in remote areas.

## Problem Statement
Tribal women often lack access to primary healthcare facilities and awareness about common conditions like PCOS, Anemia, and Breast Cancer. Language barriers and low literacy further hinder their ability to seek help. There is a need for a simple, accessible tool that can provide preliminary health guidance and connect them to medical resources.

## Proposed Solution
A web-based application with:
1.  **Icon-based UI**: To overcome literacy barriers.
2.  **ML Prediction**: To provide instant risk assessment based on symptoms.
3.  **Local Context**: Recommendations tailored to their lifestyle and available resources.
4.  **Offline Capability (Future)**: To work in low-connectivity regions.

## Implementation Details
- **Dataset**: Synthetic dataset representing common symptoms and diseases.
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier for robust prediction.
- **Interface**: High-contrast, responsive web interface accessible on mobile devices.

## Future Scope
- Integration with real-time hospital databases.
- Multi-language support (Voice-based interaction).
- SMS-based alerts for users without smartphones.
